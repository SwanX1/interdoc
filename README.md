# interdoc

This is a [bun](https://bun.sh/) app for generating simple (GitHub flavoured) markdown files documenting interfaces.

This tool is useful for people who don't want to write unreadable docs for JSON syntax by hand, or want to use a familiar syntax for declaring the syntax.

To use, run the following command in your terminal
```
$ bun i -g interdoc
```
and then you can run
```
$ interdoc
```
to your heart's extent!
